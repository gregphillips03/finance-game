/*
This simple component creates a Route where the child component that it renders contains the passed in props. 
The Route component takes a prop called component that represents the component that will be rendered when a matching route is found. 
We want our childProps to be sent to this component.
The Route component can also take a render method in place of the component. 
This allows us to control what is passed in to our component.
Based on this we can create a component that returns a Route and takes a component and childProps prop. 
This allows us to pass in the component we want rendered and the props that we want applied.
Finally, we take component (set as C) and props (set as cProps) and render inside our Route using the inline function; 
props => <C {...props} {...cProps} />. 
Note, the props variable in this case is what the Route component passes us. 
Whereas, the cProps is the childProps that want to set.
